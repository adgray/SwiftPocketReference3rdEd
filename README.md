# Swift Pocket Reference, 3rd Ed

Code and resources from my O'Reilly title ["Swift Pocket Reference 3rd Edition"](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/swift-pocket-reference/9781491981702/ "Swift Pocket Reference 3rd Edition"), published by O'Reilly Media.

The code here generally follows the examples from the book, in the same order. In some places, the code includes additional comments that were removed from the text for reasons of space.  In some places, variable and constant names are different in the code to allow more examples to be packed into the one playground (and in ordder to keep the code in the book as clean as possible).

The code is presented here in the form of Xcode Playgrounds, which allows for simple experimentation and tinkering with instant results. 

In some Playgrounds, you should expose the console output pane to see the output of 'print' command. To do that, open the View menu, and choose Debug Area -> Show Debug Area, or use the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-Y.

This branch was tested against Xcode 8.1 and Swift 3.02.
